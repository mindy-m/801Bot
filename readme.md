Forked 801bot code that has been repurposed.  Currently being used as a color picker for the LED on an Adafruit QT Py ESP32-S3 (the cutest ESP32-S3!)

# Original: 801bot 

Small robot with WiFi control. Designed for the 801Labs Hackerspace's 2023 Holiday Project, but open for everyone.

Built with an ESP32 microcontroller and SG90-CR servo motors (sometimes called 360Â° or continuous servos). 

You can find [Assembly](Instructions/build.md) and [Programming](Instructions/programming.md) guides in the Instructions folder.

A zip file of the Arduino program to upload to the robot is available in the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/n1ghtBl00d/801Bot/releases/tag/latest).

The 3D printable files can be found on the [Printables Project](https://www.printables.com/model/673991-801bot).
